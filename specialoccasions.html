      <h2>Zingermans</h2>
      <p> The most famous restaurant in Ann Arbor. Zingermans is known throughout the US as the go to deli in Ann Arbor. When students are entering their freshman year of college, many are gifted with a gift card to Zingermans. You can smell the aromas of fresh bread, cheese and desserts from around the corner. Entering the deli is a foodies heaven--baked goods on the right, huge cheese cabinet on the left, sliced meats in the next case, oils and spreads around the corner and then you approach the menu. The menu is filled with any sandwich you could image and their sides are not something to skimp on either. Order everything you can, I can't stress that enough. </p>

    <h2>Frita Batidos</h2>
    <p> Frita Batidos was the first restaurant I tried in Ann Arbor when I came to tour it my senior year of high school. There was nothing more satisying than that first bite. A beef frita, sweet chili mayo, avocado spread, and a sunny side up egg all on a perfectly fresh egg bun. The spicy, sweet, creamy, tangy combination was irrisistable and six minutes later my hands and face were covered in food but my stomach couldn't have been happier. Frita Batidos is unlike anything I've ever had and will always be a special occasion spot for me as I will continute to remember that first bite. </p>

  <h2>Fleetwood Diner</h2>
  <p> Meaty Hippie Hash with eggs over easy please. I have never tried anything else at Fleetwood and realistically I never will because why fix something if it isn't broken. Fleetwood is the place to be at 7am, 11am, 9pm, and 3am. Yes, Fleetwood is open 24/7. Their hours and their food gave this diner a spot in the special occasions category. The tiny diner walls are covered floor to ceiling with stickers from customers over the years. This quaint restaurant is the perfect place to catch up with friends after a night out while feasting on a hash of corned beef, potatoes, tomatoes, broccoli, onions and eggs. An absolute must. </p>

<h2>Chop House</h2>
<p> I swear by it, Chop House serves the best steak in all of Ann Arbor. Perfectly cooked, incredibly juicy, and don't forget about the unbelievable sides. Although on the pricier side, splitting a steak here is the route to go. It is always enough food that it's basically two for the price of one! And pro tip: go on your birthday and you'll get 50% off for you and your plus one. If you're looking for a nice night out with steak, wine, potatoes and incredible chocolate cake...you have to go to Chop House.</p>

<h2>Pacific Rim</h2>
<p> Pacific Rim is an Asian Fusion restaurant away from central campus. Just a few blocks down toward Main St. this quaint and unique restuarant is an absolute treat whenever you can get there. The chef puts a spin on all of the classics: Vietnamese Beef Lettuce Wrap, Thai-Style Calamari, and Southeast Asian Crabcakes. You can't go wrong with any of the dishes Pacific Rim has to offer.</p>
