        <h2>Aventura</h2>
        <p> Looking for a place for your upcoming birthday dinner? Aventura is a perfect spot. Aventura can accomodate large parties in their private rooms and parties of smaller sizes in their main room. It is a Spanish Tapas restaurant that is perfect for sharing. Their small dishes pack a ton of flavor and are perfectly complimented by their delicious sangria. They are famous for their pallela and charcuterie boards. Aventura creates an exciting atmosphere with the contrast between darkness and neon pops of light. You have to hit Aventura before heading out of Ann Arbor. </p>

    <h2>Mani</h2>
    <p>Mani is the best Italian restaurant in Ann Arbor. Must order items include their caesar salad and tartufo pizza. The salad is dressed beautifully and topped with a fried poached egg with a runny yolk that melds perfectly into the dressing. Up next is the tartufo pizza--a white pizza covered in mushrooms and similarly topped with a sunny side up egg. The crust is just the right amount of crispy and chewy and the mushroom adding the necessary umami to break up the creaminess of the egg and cheese. Mani is a more upscale restaurant in the area that is sure to impress any visitors.  </p>

  <h2>Mikette</h2>
  <p> Mikette is an incredible French option in the area. Closer to north campus, it allows for a quick escape from the hustle and bustle of central, state street, and downtown. The location is a strip mall is misleading as Mikette is an elegant spot that brings a taste of Paris to Ann Arbor. There is a wide variety of wines to start off the night, the half chicken is perfectly seasoned for your entree and finish off the meal with a creamy and spicy carrot cake.</p>

<h2>Slurping Turtle</h2>
<p> Slurping Turtle is my go to for high quality ramen, sushi, bao buns, and poke. They perfectly nail the idea of Asian Fusion and I am never disappointed by my visits. The variety on the menu is sure to appeal to all. The Pink Lady Roll is my ideal sushi roll and the pork bao bun is tangy, sweet, and spicy all at once. Slurping gets pretty busy during the weekends but fortunately you can put your name down, head to a coffee shop or grab a drink and they'll let you know when your table is almost ready. Whether you're looking for warm ramen on a cold night or a fresh poke dish, Slurping Turtle is a must. </p>

<h2>Savas</h2>
<p> Savas is an Ann Arbor classic. Reservations for graduation, parents weekend and homecoming weekend are booked well in advance and for good reason. Savas is open for brunch, lunch and dinner and the dishes for each are unique and satisfying. The mac and cheese is unlike anything you've ever had including a mix of four different cheeses. The greek salad is one to right home about. Unlike typical greek salads that are watery and bland, Savas' salad is packed with a ton of flavor and I wish I could take the dressing home with me. The burgers are a fan favorite and you can't go wrong with any of the appetizers. You don't want to miss out on Savas!</p>
