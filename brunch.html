      <h2>Avalon</h2>
      <p> Avalon has an incredible array of brunch options. The food is more upscale than your classic diner but the food remains incredibly affordable. My go to options at Avalon include the avocado toast, the bacon avocado breakfast sandwich, and the fried chicken sandwich. The avocado toast is topped with ribbons of cucumber, a drizzle of tahini and a sprinkle of chili. The bacon avocado sandwich is topped with an over easy egg and an out of this world aioli-although messy, this sandwich is out of this world. The fried chicken sandwich is a new addition to my list of favorites. The chicken is perfectly moist yet crispy, with a fresh slaw and served on an amazing biscuit. No matter what you order, Avalon is an absolute hit!</p>

    <h2>Angelos</h2>
    <p> Angelos is everyone's go to brunch place on a Sunday morning. You'll find the line out the door and alumnis are guaranteed to hit this spot when visiting for a gameday. Everyone comes here for the omlettes with whatever fixins you want to add to it. My opinion is to not sleep on the smoked salmon benedict...it never disappoints! Just like Avalon, Angelos is famous for their homemade white and raisin toast available by the loaf and served as a side with almost any meal. Angelos is a homey, efficient and delicious diner that you're sure to fall in love with upon first bite.</p>

  <h2>Dimos</h2>
  <p> Dimos is the hidden gem of Ann Arbor. Once you've found it, I guarantee you'll be going...or wanting to go just about once a week. Dimos is an order at the counter style restaurant. There is a case of donuts just right of the register that are impossible to resist and they taste just as good as they smell. Dimos has a menu filled with a ton of sandwiches but I will never stray away from my go to: the Don Van. The Don Van is an off the menu Bacon, Egg, Cheese, and Hashbrown sandwich on a bagel. This greasy sandwich is the perfect meal after a long night out. Add a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot and don't forget about the donut at the front and you're all set.</p>

<h2>Wilmas</h2>
<p> Wilmas is a cute order at the counter, cafe-esque restaurant that is perfect for a quick bite or to set up shop with your laptop and crank out work for hours. You can order breakfast or lunch but I typically stick to the breakfast menu. From egg and cheese sandwiches, to acai bowls and and breakfast burritos, everyone is sure to find the meal of their liking. If you're looking for a lighter breakfast as opposed to a greasy, heavy meal, Wilmas is your place to be for a fresh and easy treat.</p>

<h2>Juicy Kitchen</h2>
<p> Juicy Kitchen is your go to if you're looking to leave the typical Ann Arbor brunch scene. They use the freshest ingredients which fuze together to create an incredible dish whether you choose  one of their breakfast sliders or the Hot Mess. The small sized restaurant creates an intimate space. Their coffee is straight from Ann Arbor's local Roos Roast and you can't leave without picking up one of their Date and Tahini cookies for the road. Whenever you need a healthier brunch that's a drive away, make Juicy Kitchen your place.</p>
